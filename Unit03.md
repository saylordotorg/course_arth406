monuments in Tibet, the Great Kumbum Stupa at Gyanstse, and the Potala
Palace.  The second half of the unit examines Newar Buddhism practiced
in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, concentrating on Nepalese painting and
sculpture, and the Boudhanath and Swayambhunath stupas in the Kathmandu
Valley.  After completing this unit, you will be able to identify the
