**Unit 4: Buddhist Art and Architecture in China, Korea, and Japan**
<span id="4"></span> 
*This unit examines the development of Mahayana Buddhist art and
architecture in China, Korea, and Japan, following its transmission to
East Asia via the Silk Roads.  We will first focus on Chinese Buddhist
art and architecture from the fourth through the ninth centuries CE and
then examine Buddhist art in Korea until the founding of the Chos?n
dynasty in 1392.  Finally, we will survey the development of Buddhist
art and architecture in Japan from roughly the sixth through the
sixteenth centuries.  After completing this unit, you will be able to
identify major Chinese, Korean, and Japanese Buddhist monuments, the
types of Buddhist paintings, sculpture, and ritual objects made and used
by East Asian Buddhist practitioners, and the relationship between
Buddhist art and architecture from these three countries.*
