**Unit 1: Early Buddhist Art and Architecture in India** <span
id="1"></span> 
*This unit focuses on the development of Buddhist art and architecture
on the Indian subcontinent.  It begins with an overview of Buddhism and
Buddhist iconography.  The unit then traces the development of Buddhist
art and architecture from its early aniconic stage (3rd-2<sup>nd</sup>
c. BCE) through the Gupta Period (320-550 CE), in which the form of the
Buddha (which would prove to be the model used by generations of artists
to come) took shape.  Finally it focuses on the importance of pilgrimage
in Buddhism and the transmission of Buddhism and Buddhist Art across the
Silk Roads.  After completing this unit, you will have a comprehensive
understanding of the central beliefs of Buddhism, the major elements of
Buddhist iconography, the early development of Buddhist art and
architecture in India, and the role the Silk Roads played in the
transmission of Buddhism to Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the
Himalayas.*
