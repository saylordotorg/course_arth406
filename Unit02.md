**Unit 2: Buddhist Art and Architecture in Southeast Asia** <span
id="2"></span> 
*This unit examines Theravada and Mahayana Buddhist art and architecture
from Southeast Asia, where Buddhism often coexisted alongside Hinduism
after the sixth century.  It begins with an overview of Southeast Asian
Buddhism and art.  Then, the unit focuses on Buddhist art and
architecture created during the reigns of the Sailendra kings of Java
(8<sup>th</sup>-9<sup>th</sup> century), King Jayavarman VII of Cambodia
(the Khmer ruler of the late 12<sup>th</sup> and early 13<sup>th</sup>
centuries), the Pagan rulers of Myanmar (11<sup>th</sup>-14th
centuries), and the Ayutthaya rulers of Thailand (1351–1767).  After
completing this unit, you will be able to identify major Southeast Asian
Buddhist monuments and artworks and the important role that Buddhist and
Hindu art played in definitions of Southeast Asian kingship.*
