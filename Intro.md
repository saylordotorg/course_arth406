This course serves as an introduction to the Buddhist artistic
traditions of South, Southeast, and East Asia, as well as the
Himalayas.  It is organized into four units based on the development of
Buddhist schools and artistic traditions in Southeast Asia, the
Himalayas, and China, Korea, and Japan.  The first unit surveys the core
tenets of Buddhism, Buddhist iconography, and early Buddhist art and
architecture in India.  The second unit reviews the development of
Buddhist art and architecture in Southeast Asia, focusing on the
patronage of Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism by rulers in the modern
countries of Indonesia, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Thailand.  Unit three
examines the particular form of Vajrayana Buddhism and its artistic
traditions that developed in the Himalayas.  The final unit traces the
spread of Mahayana Buddhist art and architecture into China and later
into Korea and Japan via the Silk Roads.  All four units highlight the
interaction between Buddhist doctrine, art, and architecture; Buddhism’s
adaptability to local contexts; and the commissioning of Buddhist art
and architecture to legitimize political, social, and cultural power.
After this course, you should be able to identify major Buddhist
monuments and artworks of South, Southeast, and East Asia, as well as
the Himalayas.  Through this course, you will gain an understanding of
how Buddhism and Buddhist art developed in each of these regional
contexts.
